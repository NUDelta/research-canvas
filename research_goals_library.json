		"Does the use of wearable devices or contextual touch, like the Apple Watch or 3D Touch on iPhone 6S/6S+, facilitate and encourage low-effort contributions for on-the-go crowds?",
		"Can on-the-go users be encouraged to contribute data by",
		"incentivizing them with information about opportunities of interest to them?",
		"How might I direct individual on-the-go users to contribute specific, small pieces of information that can be scaffolded into higher fidelity information while ensuring that data coverage goals are met?",
		"Is it possible to encourage on-the-go crowds (individuals on a set route) to contribute lower-fidelity data points that, with scaffolding, yield high-fidelity data while ensuring complete data coverage (e.g. the description of a building facades from data points on architectural style, number of windows/doors, etc.) and (2) will the use of low-effort contributions (ones that do not require completion of a time consuming form) increase user participation in sensing tasks.",
		"Before the user is prompted to perform a game action, how can we guarantee the action is along the path they are walking?",
		"Plan to look into Pre-Tracking for this",
		"As the user performs game actions, how can we store information from phone sensors and processes it to extract meaningful information? ",
		"Potentially machine learning algorithms and working with Habit Sourcing",
		"After a user completes a game action, how can we give them feedback to signal they have correctly or incorrectly completed the task? What does feedback look like?",
		"Either visual or audio feedback through the userâ€™s phone",
		"As a user continues to play, how should tasks build (or not build) on each other? How does a user progress through the game? What does the end look like? ",
		"Looking at games like WarioWare and Journey for ideas and examples",
		"How can we learn about the physical world through user play and use this information and data to grow the existing game world?",
		"PSYCHOLOGICAL BENEFIT: Does a collective experience (HQ: depends on the CE, are we asking about canonical CEs or is there some particular type of CE) actually help people to feel more connected to others/part of something greater? Does that feeling make them more satisfied/content with life? ",
		"DESIRABILITY OF EXPERIENCE (helps experience designers): What features/characteristics of an experience attract more users to a) subscribe to it, b) actually participate in an experience event?",
		"MECHANISMS FOR ACHIEVING OUTCOME: How can we facilitate successful outcomes/documentations? (what incentives, coordination, recruiting, routing, algorithm, etc.) ",
		"SOCIAL: Do users want to do collective experiences with people they know? Do they rely on existing social groups? How can we help them to form new bonds/relationships?",
		"How can we build a system with features that will best help beginning web developers complete a complex personal project?",
		"Similarly, how can we build a system with features that will best help experts compose a usable action plan as efficiently as possible?",
		"Does the use of wearable devices or contextual touch, like the Apple Watch or 3D Touch on iPhone 6S/6S+, facilitate and encourage low-effort contributions for on-the-go crowds?  ",
		"Can small pieces of data from on-the-go users be scaffolded together to create information that rivals the fidelity of full surveys?"
